# Making Sex-Ed accessible for Students - Case Study

## Our Vision

Our App takes the awkward out of sex ed. Real information in fun content gives you all the answers you want to know about sex, body, and relationships. We choose to harness digital media's power to provide young adolescents around the globe with medically accurate, age-appropriate, affirmative, and honest sex education they can access directly online—regardless of where they live or what school they attend. The App helps in systematic learning, enhanced interaction, and is available 24/7 even if your school hasn't opted to teach you this module. The App includes unique features such as a "symptom checker," " schedule an appointment, " etc. In the future, we intend to extend our audience by introducing more languages. We are incredibly passionate about our mission, i.e., we aim to educate by providing 100% accurate information.

## Why Middle School?

- Students need to understand what’s happening to their bodies, learn the basics of sexuality and reproduction, and pick up some refusal skills in preparation for sexual shenanigans in middle school.
- Such education can also help youth to enhance the quality of their relationships and to develop decision-making skills that will prove invaluable over life
- Young people are going to learn about sex somehow. It's unavoidable. Rather than have them learn from the media or their uninformed peers, a quality sexuality education curriculum can prepare them for real life

## Why should we have Sex-Education?

- The objectives of sex education are to make children/young adults aware of the anatomy of human sexes and also to acquit them about the birth process.
- Educate children to establish and accept the roles and responsibilities of their own gender by acquiring the knowledge of sex
- Understanding the differences and similarities between all genders in terms of body and mind will establish a foundation for future development in their acquaintance with friends and lovers and their interpersonal relationship
- Sex education is an important part of holistic education. It teaches an individual about self-acceptance and the attitude and skills of interpersonal relationship.
- It also assists an individual to cultivate a sense of responsibility towards others as well as oneself
